## Brand Essence

- **Tone**: Elegant, confident, understated  
- **Impression**: Calm luxury, contemporary sophistication, editorial clarity  

The website should feel as though it was crafted by a top-tier design agency: minimal, precise, and timeless.

## Core Principles
1. **Minimalism** — No clutter, no unnecessary decoration. Every element should have a clear reason to exist.  
2. **Editorial Aesthetic** — Large, bold typography and striking imagery, like a luxury magazine.  
3. **Whitespace & Calm** — Generous spacing to create air and rhythm. Content should never feel cramped.  
4. **Consistency** — Reuse the same shapes, colors, and styles throughout.  
5. **Professionalism** — No emojis, no gimmicks, no informal tone.

## Color Palette
- **Background**: White (`#FFFFFF`)  
- **Text (Ink)**: Black (`#111111`)  
- **Accent**: Dark Green (`#0F3B2F`)  
- **Lines / Dividers**: Light Gray (`#E9ECEB`)  

The palette is deliberately restrained: black, white, and dark green carry the entire brand. This creates focus and confidence.

---

## Typography
- **Headlines**: Editorial serif with strong presence (e.g. Fraunces).  
- **Body**: Clean, modern sans-serif (e.g. Inter).  
- **Scale**: Confident, with oversized headings balanced by spacious layouts.  
- **Treatment**: Headlines are design elements. Text must always be legible, never ornamental.

---

## Imagery
- **Lighting**: Natural, bright, with soft contrasts.  
- **Mood**: Stylish, calm, contemporary.  
- **Subjects**: Elegant French dishes, close-up details of plating, interiors with atmosphere.  
- **Treatment**: Minimal post-processing; no heavy filters.  
- **Presentation**: Large hero images may be masked into oval shapes for distinctiveness.

---

## Shapes & Forms
- **Hero Image**: Oval-mask for distinct, premium character.  
- **Buttons**: Pill-shaped, refined, and consistent across the site.  
- **Cards**: Simple rectangles with subtle radii and light shadows.  
- **Shadows**: Minimal and soft; only where depth is needed.

---

## Motion & Interaction
- **Animation**: Minimal and subtle — fade-ins, small lifts.  
- **Performance**: Smooth and fast, never distracting.  
- **Accessibility**: All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

---

## Experience Goals
- **Calm Confidence**: The user feels welcomed into a refined, elegant environment.  
- **Effortless Clarity**: Navigation and actions are obvious without shouting.  
- **Timeless Modernity**: A design that feels just as relevant five years from now.
